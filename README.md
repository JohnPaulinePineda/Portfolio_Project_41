This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_41/) explores the various methods in assessing data quality, implementing data preprocessing and conducting exploratory analysis for prediction problems with categorical responses. A non-exhaustive list of methods to detect missing data, extreme outlying points, near-zero variance, multicollinearity and skewed distributions were evaluated. Remedial procedures on addressing data quality issues including missing data imputation, centering and scaling transformation, shape transformation and outlier treatment were similarly considered, as applicable.
